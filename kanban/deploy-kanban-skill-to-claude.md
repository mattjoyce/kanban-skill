# Deploy Kanban Skill To Claude

## Job Story
When updating local workflow docs, I want the Kanban skill installed in Claude, so I can use the board rules consistently during work sessions.

## Narrative
- 2026-02-07: Synced the skill between repo and global Claude config and established the repo as the source of truth.
